# Robotics-Summer-Camp-IIT-BHU-Pybullet-Basics-Solutions

Let me first give a brief discription about this Robotics Summer Camp 2021.
Robotics Summer Camp is an annual camp organised by Robotics Club of IIT BHU.
This camp is totally dedicated towards giving knowledge and skill in field of Robotics to the frehers or first yearites of IIT BHU.

Here, is a github link to the official github account of <a href = "https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU">Robotics Club</a>.

Here, I am presenting my solutions on varios exciting tasks which we faced towards the first phase of this camp, that is,
the BASIC PYBULLET SIMULATIONS with some basic urdf files building.

The whole camp is designed on weekely basic and the course structures is designed by various core members of Robotics CLub.

Here, is the link to go to the github account of <a href = "https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/Robotics-Camp-2021">Phase I</a> of this camp.

However, on moving ahead in this course the students are given the freedom to choose their field of specialisation.
The camp includes four fields of specialisation:

1. Hardware Design and Simulation
2. Robot Learning
3. Control and Dyanamics
